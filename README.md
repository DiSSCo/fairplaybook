## About this Playbook Template

This **FAIR Research Data Management Playbook** is designed as a **template** to help organizations implement best practices in managing research data following the FAIR principles. It's a practical guide to make research data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)** across various stages of the data lifecycle.

### Why Use This Template?

The playbook provides a flexible structure that you can **adapt** to your organization’s specific data management needs. It’s not a strict policy document but a **living resource** that can evolve with your projects, data types, and technologies.

### Inspiration from the FAIR Cookbook

Much like the [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/), this playbook follows a **"recipe" approach**, guiding you step-by-step through different stages of research data management. Each "Play" provides you with:
- **Clear, actionable steps** for tasks like data creation, preservation, or sharing
- **Key considerations** to ensure compliance with FAIR principles
- **Links to resources** and external tools to help you along the way

### Sharing Your Playbook

Once customized, your organization can share its own version of the playbook with internal teams, collaborators, or publicly on GitHub to foster knowledge exchange on FAIR data management practices.
