## About this Playbook Template

This **FAIR Research Data Management Playbook** is designed as a **template** to help organizations implement best practices in managing research data following the FAIR principles. It's a practical guide to make research data **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)** across various stages of the data lifecycle.

### Why Use This Template?

The playbook provides a flexible structure that you can **adapt** to your organization’s specific data management needs. It’s not a strict policy document but a **living resource** that can evolve with your projects, data types, and technologies.

### How to Reuse and Customize this Playbook?

1. **Clone or Fork the Repository**  
   You can start by forking or cloning this repository to your own GitHub account or download it directly for use within your organization.

2. **Edit the Template to Suit Your Needs**  
   - Modify (based on the audience in mind) or expand the existing "Plays" to reflect your organization's data management processes and guidelines. For instance, this template can be used to create a playbook based on the Herbarium Data Management Plan (by The Meise Botanic Garden: [https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e124288](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.10.e124288))
   - Customize the resources, examples, and workflows to match the tools, repositories, and policies used by your team.
   - Add or remove steps based on the types of data your organization manages.
 

3. **Contribute to the Playbook**  
   This template is designed to grow. We encourage you to share your modifications or suggestions by submitting a pull request or creating a discussion on how to improve the playbook.

4. **Leverage as a Training Resource**  
   Use this playbook as a learning tool for training staff and new project members on the importance of FAIR principles and the specifics of your data management policies.

### Inspiration from the FAIR Cookbook

Much like the [FAIR Cookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/), this playbook follows a **"recipe" approach**, guiding you step-by-step through different stages of research data management. Each "Play" provides you with:
- **Clear, actionable steps** for tasks like data creation, preservation, or sharing
- **Key considerations** to ensure compliance with FAIR principles
- **Links to resources** and external tools to help you along the way

### Sharing Your Playbook

Once customized, your organization can share its own version of the playbook with internal teams, collaborators, or publicly on GitHub to foster knowledge exchange on FAIR data management practices.
